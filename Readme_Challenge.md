## Overview of Project

## Purpose
Analysis of the Theater Funding Goals based on Launch dates for the show Fever to provide useful information to Louise when planning shows. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There was a 12 month period for the show to air.  The Launch of the show in January indicated that there was consistency in the number of successful and failed shows across that period of time.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were no challenges or difficulties processing the data for this module.  The challenges encountered by the team was identifying and setting realistic goals for their funding activities

The challenges encountered during this project was trying to follow along on the project and going back and forth between the screens.  There should be an option to allow students to download the content and documents notes and questions easier.  As a visual learner who also need to write out information, this single version of communication has crippled my ability to quickly get through the modules. 

## Results
The most successful funding activities occurred when the goals were less than $15,000 and between $35K - 45K.  There should be some additional consideration in goal setting.
